*`Population vs Growth Rate`*

The relation between population of a country is depicted in the graph below. Key finding from this graph is "**Growth rate is inversely proportional to income category."**

```{r}

# Population and Density
economics_life |>
  drop_na() |>
  select(pop2022, Density, continent) |>
  ggplot(aes(Density, pop2022, color = continent)) +
  geom_point()+
    scale_x_log10()+
    scale_y_log10()

```

```{r}
economics_life |>
  drop_na() |>
  select(area, Density, continent) |>
  ggplot(aes(Density, area, color = continent)) +
  geom_point()+
    scale_x_log10()

```

```{r}
economics_life |>
    select(GrowthRate, income.group, Region, continent) |>
    ggplot(aes(y = GrowthRate, x = income.group, color = continent)) +
    geom_point()
```
