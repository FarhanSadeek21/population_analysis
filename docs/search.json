I like to read\r\nnon-fiction, and spend time with my family members.\r\nAbout the Project\r\nAnalysis of World Population and Economy\r\n3rd planet from the Sun, Earth is home to 193 nations. Economically\r\nall the nations are different from each other. All these nations differ\r\nfrom one another in different ways. The purpose of this project is to\r\nidentify those differences and investigate the root cause with the help\r\nof data science.\r\nGoals\r\nIdentify different indices of life index\r\nInvestigate how economy impacts those indices\r\n“This is Data Science”\r\n\r\nPreceptor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Key finding from this graph is “Except micronations there\r\nis no correlation between population and density”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key takeaways from this graph:\r\nThe population density can be as low as 20 and\r\ngo all the way to 10000 per square kilometer.\r\nMost countries regardless of their location, income or economic\r\nprogress tend to have the similar population density.\r\nGrowth Rate\r\nThe relation between growth rate of a country and per capita income\r\nis depicted in the graph below. Key finding from this graph is “Growth\r\nrate is inversely proportional to per capita income.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key takeaways from this graph:\r\nMost countries tend to have density around 100 to 500 per square\r\nkilometer.\r\nCountries with low income fall into the\r\ndeveloping category and have very high growth\r\nrate.\r\nCountries with high income fall into the\r\ndeveloped category and have very low growth\r\nrate. Generally those countries have a growth rate lying\r\nbetween -1% and 1%.\r\nEconomic Progress\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKey takeaways from the graph are listed below:\r\nEurope is dominated by developed countries, but\r\nthe rest are filled with developing countries.\r\nDeveloping countries are more common that developed\r\ncountries.\r\nSouth America, North America\r\nand Africa is filled with mostly developing\r\ncountries.\r\nAsia and Oceania is consists of\r\nboth developing and developed countries.\r\nLending Category and Economy\r\nIDA stands for International Development\r\nAssociation, which is one of the largest and most effective\r\nplatforms for fighting extreme poverty in the world’s poorest countries.\r\nOn the other hand, IBRD stands for the\r\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development,\r\ncommonly referred as World Bank. IBRD\r\nassists the development of its member nation’s territories, promotes and\r\nsupplements private foreign investment and promoting long-range\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKey takeaways from the graph are listed below:\r\nMost developing countries are located in\r\nAfrica. So these nations have to depend a lot on loans\r\nfrom IDA to develop the quality of life.\r\nEurope is the most developed continent, therefore, most European\r\nnations don’t need any loans to operate their economy.\r\nAsia consists of both developed and developing nations. So\r\nthere’s a diversity among Asian nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It was found that affect of\r\nimmunization and human development index was not taken into account in\r\nthe past. Also, some of the past research was done considering multiple\r\nlinear regression based on data set of one year for all the countries.\r\nHence, this gives motivation to resolve both the factors stated\r\npreviously by formulating a regression model based on mixed effects\r\nmodel and multiple linear regression while considering data from a\r\nperiod of 2000 to 2015 for all the countries. Important immunization\r\nlike Hepatitis B, Polio and Diphtheria will also be considered. In a\r\nnutshell, this study will focus on immunization factors, mortality\r\nfactors, economic factors, social factors and other health related\r\nfactors as well. Since the observations this dataset are based on\r\ndifferent countries, it will be easier for a country to determine the\r\npredicting factor which is contributing to lower value of life\r\nexpectancy. This will help in suggesting a country which area should be\r\ngiven importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of\r\nits population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
